# QR Code Generator

Dear all,

I am pleased to announce the development of a new web application designed to generate secure QR codes for official correspondence.

This solution was initially created for EPO Region 10, but its scalable design allows it to be adopted by other regions. I believe this tool will enhance the security and efficiency of our official communications.

Best regards,

Monte Kietpawpan, Ph.D.
EPO Region 10 Director
